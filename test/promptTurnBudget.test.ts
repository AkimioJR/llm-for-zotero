/**
 * Per-turn prompt budget: serialized tools + fixed system prompt + the
 * per-turn user message (dynamic guidance, resource context and request), for
 * the three common turn shapes, with the bundled skill inventory installed. The
 * caps are what this same measurement gives at ff8eaf7e (the commit before the
 * agent tool consolidation), so moving always-on rules into per-turn guidance
 * cannot silently grow a turn. The global and collection caps were raised on
 * purpose by the workflow sentence that asks for a digest part when the work
 * needs one result per paper (274 characters, 2026-10-02), and again by
 * submit_document's excluded list, which records the papers a document
 * leaves out (214 tool characters, 2026-10-02), and again by literature_search
 * saying that its metadata mode proposes changes for the user to approve, so
 * a review never asks to change an item it only reads, and that it searches
 * outside the library only on request (324 tool characters, 2026-10-03),
 * and again by the citation contract saying how to quote a passage that has
 * no ID instead of constructing one, and to copy quoted text with its
 * extraction artifacts (190 characters, 2026-10-09), and again by the
 * agent stop rules' lookup-first route: library_search says to look a named
 * paper up by title or author first, and the library_retrieve guidance tells
 * a candidate from a found paper and a paper's passage absence from its
 * absence from the library (249 characters, 2026-10-13), and again when
 * that guidance said to check a candidate's title and authors against what
 * was asked and to name it with what matches and what does not, after a
 * benchmark run where the shorter rule led to a false "not in your
 * library" for a paper the agent had read (100 characters, 2026-10-13).
 * All three caps were raised again by past_chat_read, the always-listed tool
 * that opens past chats the user attached to the conversation (510 tool
 * characters, 2026-10-18); a turn with nothing attached is otherwise
 * unchanged. Raised again by its query search (the query field and one
 * sentence of description: 133, 99 and 133 characters, 2026-10-18). Raised
 * again by past_chat_search and past_chat_attach, the always-listed tools
 * that find an earlier chat and add it to the user's message (733
 * characters each, 2026-10-19).
